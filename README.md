# unix aliases

This alias script does gives you helpful scripts for you.
Often you waste your time typing bunch of verbose commands and its
arguments but it is not necessary.
And the more chance you type those command sequences, it means you
often waste you time for those repetitive commandline strokes because
you do not have any alias for it.
This script does solve this issue.
